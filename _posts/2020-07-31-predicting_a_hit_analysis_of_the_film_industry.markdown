When it comes to the film industry, what makes a hit?  Are there certain features of top grossing films that can nearly guarantee that a movie performs well at the box office?  This is what we've explored in a fun data analysis project.  

To put a cool spin on this project, we decided to give it a little bit of a backstory.  In  this alternate data analysis dimension, Microsoft has recognized that other large tech corporations have found ample success in the film industry by producing their own original content.  The new plan:  Microsoft Studios.  This new venture could create an entirely new revenue stream for the company as well as provide many opportunites to synergize with existing Microsoft products.  Sounds like a great idea, right? 

However, with a high-dollar point of entry and Mircosoft's sterling reputation on the line, this can also prove to be risky.  How can we minimize the risk and maximize the return on investment by using a data driven production system?

Over the course of this project, we wanted to answer the following questions:
- Is there a correlation between a film's budget and it's performance at the box office?
- Do films in certain genres perform better at the box office?  If so, which genres?
- Is there a correlation between a film's MPAA rating and it's ROI?
- Does a film's runtime have any effect on worldwide gross?

## The Data

## Scrubbing

## Analysis

### Budget vs. Revenue

### Genres

### MPAA Rating

### Runtime of the Film

## Conclusion
The fictious creation of Microsoft studios offers the opportunity for the company to create an entirely new revenue stream by getting in on the content creation game in producing feature films.  Since the Microsoft reputation is on the line, we obviously want to make hits.  This task isn't without risk, so we decided to analyze data directly from the film industry to see if there were any ways we can hedge our bet by using a data-driven production system. 

So what have we learned?
- The most consistently high rate of return occurs when a production budget is $183 million.
- The most profitable film genre is animation.
- The most profitable films tend to be rated PG
- Fi;ms should aim to be roughtly 115 minutes in length. 

### Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, we would be able to provide Microsoft Studios with the following recommendations:
- The film should be made with a production budget of $183 million.
- The genre of the film should be animation.
- The film should be rated PG
- This film should be 115 minutes in length. 

### Future Work
There are a variety of other aspects that I would like to tackle in the future.  These include:
- Are established film franchises more of a 'sure-thing'?
- Do major award nominations affect overall earnings?
- Is it worth exploring creating and producing content exclusively for streaming platforms?
